## Non-Hacker News

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is one of the best news sources for technology-related content, particularly because none of it is dumbed down - the signal-to-noise ratio is very high.

But the non-technical news on it is also excellent. Here are two examples:

- [Economic Analysis of Medicare-for-All](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18613722)
- [The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17172546)

These are pieces of serious long-form analysis and journalism, respectively.
